// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  Massar — DeletionLog
//  Location: app/Models/DeletionLog.php
//
//  One row per financial record deleted anywhere in the app — see
//  the migration's doc comment for why this exists.
//
//  Deliberately does NOT use BelongsToCompany: this table is a
//  record of what happened, and it must remain fully readable by a
//  platform admin regardless of which company it belongs to. Any
//  company-side screen that lists these must filter by company_id
//  itself, the same way DashboardController's raw queries do.
//
//  No `created_at`/`updated_at` — a log entry is written once, at
//  the moment of deletion, and never changed, so `deleted_at` IS
//  the meaningful timestamp; there's nothing else to track it
//  against. $timestamps = false turns off Eloquent's automatic
//  created_at/updated_at handling entirely — nulling only
//  UPDATED_AT (as an earlier version of this file did) still left
//  Eloquent trying to write created_at on every insert, which
//  doesn't exist as a column here and made every single deletion
//  in the app throw a 500 error. Caught by a real `php artisan
//  test` run against MySQL — sqlite's looser column handling had
//  let it slip through everywhere else.
