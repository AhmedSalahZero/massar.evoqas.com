     * This has to be ordinary session data, not flashed data. It used
     * to be flashed — `redirect()->with('email', ...)` — which
     * survives exactly one request. So the verification screen knew
     * the address the first time it rendered and never again: a
     * refresh, or pressing "Resend code" (which redirects back, and
     * that is a fresh request), left the page with no address at all.
     *
     * The visible symptom was the Resend button being permanently
     * unclickable, because it disables itself when there is no
     * address to send to. The address is also what the code entry
     * itself is checked against, so the whole screen was one refresh
     * away from being unusable.
     *
     * Nobody is signed in at this point — registration deliberately
     * does not log anyone in until they are verified — so there is no
     * authenticated user to fall back on. The session is the only
     * place that knows.
