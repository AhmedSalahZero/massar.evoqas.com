// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  Massar — SuperAdminSeeder
//  Location: database/seeders/SuperAdminSeeder.php
//
//  Creates the one platform super_admin account (no company_id —
//  a super_admin isn't scoped to any single company; see
//  BelongsToCompany and EnsureAdmin).
//
//  QA audit fix (Sep 2026) — this seeder used to carry a working
//  password as a literal:
//
//      'password' => 'ChangeMe@2026!'
//      $this->command->info('... admin@example.app / ChangeMe@2026!');
//
//  Three separate problems, all of them fixed here:
//
//  1. The credential was in the repository, in plain text, next to
//     the email address it opened — for the one role that reads
//     every partner's data on the platform. It now comes from
//     DEFAULT_PASSWORD in .env, which is gitignored.
//
//  2. It was `updateOrCreate`, so re-running `php artisan db:seed`
//     silently RESET the password back to the published one, even
//     after the owner had changed it. The warning comment in the
//     file did not prevent that and could not. The password is now
//     written only when the account is being created; a re-run
//     leaves an existing password exactly as it is, and says so.
//
//  3. The confirmation line printed the password to the console,
//     where it lands in deploy logs and CI output. Nothing here
//     prints a password any more.
//
//  Absent or weak configuration fails loudly rather than seeding a
//  super_admin nobody can sign in as — or worse, one with a
//  guessable password nobody noticed.
