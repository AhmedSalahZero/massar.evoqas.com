//  Massar — BelongsToCompany
//
//  Applied to every domain model (Sale, Expense, Customer, ...).
//  Two things happen automatically:
//    1. New records get company_id filled from the logged-in user.
//    2. Every query is scoped to that user's company — a
//       company_admin or employee can never see another company's
//       data by accident.
//
//  A super_admin (company_id is null on their user row) is NOT
//  scoped — they see everything, which is what lets them browse
//  across companies from the admin area.
