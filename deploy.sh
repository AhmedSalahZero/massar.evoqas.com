# ── Are the compiled assets actually here? ────────────────────────
#
# This server has no Node, so public/build travels in the repository
# (see .gitignore). That worked until the folder was gitignored while
# a handful of force-added files stayed tracked: the repo shipped a
# manifest.json naming 85 assets of which 7 were present, and every
# page loaded with no JS and no CSS. Nothing failed loudly — the
# deploy said "finished successfully" and the site was broken.
#
# So: read the manifest, check every file it names is on disk, and
# refuse to leave maintenance mode if any are missing. A deploy that
# stops with the old site still up beats one that finishes and serves
# a blank page.
