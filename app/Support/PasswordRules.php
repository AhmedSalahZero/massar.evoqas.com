     * NOTE (QA audit correction, Sep 2026): a breach-check via
     * ->uncompromised() was added here and then reverted. It calls
     * out to api.pwnedpasswords.com on every password submission,
     * and — confirmed against a real test run — that call does not
     * fail open when it can't complete (e.g. a machine with no
     * trusted SSL certificate bundle configured, a firewall, or the
     * API being briefly down): it throws, and blocks the submission
     * outright. Making sign-up and password changes depend on a
     * third-party service being reachable is a worse risk than the
     * weak-password problem it was meant to catch, so it was
     * removed. If this is revisited, it needs its own timeout and a
     * deliberate fallback that treats a failed check as "allow",
     * not Laravel's default behavior.

     * enough (owner's decision), which is why ->mixedCase() is not
     * used here.
     *
     * Only applies when a password is set or changed; existing
     * passwords keep working at login.
